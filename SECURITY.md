# Security Hardening Implementation Guide

## üéØ Quick Start Checklist

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Critical Security (Do First)
- [ ] **Replace workflow file** with the new security-hardened version
- [ ] **Add Dependabot config** to `.github/dependabot.yml`
- [ ] **Verify secrets are set** in repository settings:
  - `TRADIER_TOKEN`
  - `GITHUB_TOKEN` (automatically provided)
- [ ] **Test manual workflow run** with `skip_time_gate: true`
- [ ] **Review first automated run** during next scheduled time window

### üìã Phase 2: Verification (Within 1 Week)
- [ ] Monitor Dependabot PRs for action updates
- [ ] Review GitHub Actions security alerts (if any)
- [ ] Check workflow execution logs for any warnings
- [ ] Verify data files are being generated correctly
- [ ] Confirm GitHub Pages deployment is working

### üîß Phase 3: Optimization (Optional)
- [ ] Add `checksums.txt` for pip packages (if desired)
- [ ] Enable branch protection rules on `main`
- [ ] Set up notification webhooks for failures
- [ ] Configure artifact attestations when needed

## üîí Security Improvements Applied

### 1. **SHA Pinning for Actions**
**Why:** Prevents supply chain attacks from compromised action repositories.

**What changed:**
```yaml
# Before (vulnerable)
uses: actions/checkout@v4

# After (secure)
uses: actions/checkout@b4ffde65f46336ab88eb53be808477a3936bae11  # v4.1.1
```

**Maintenance:** Dependabot will automatically create PRs when new secure versions are available.

### 2. **Minimal Token Permissions**
**Why:** Reduces blast radius if workflow is compromised.

**What changed:**
- Default: `contents: read` at workflow level
- Producer: `contents: write`, `pages: write` (only where needed)
- Consumer: `contents: read` only
- Time Gate: `contents: read` only

### 3. **Specific Ubuntu Version**
**Why:** Prevents unexpected breaking changes from OS updates.

**What changed:**
```yaml
# Before (unpredictable)
runs-on: ubuntu-latest

# After (stable)
runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
```

### 4. **Secret Validation**
**Why:** Fail fast if required secrets are missing.

**What added:**
```yaml
- name: Validate required secrets
  run: |
    if [[ -z "${{ secrets.TRADIER_TOKEN }}" ]]; then
      echo "::error::TRADIER_TOKEN secret is not configured"
      exit 1
    fi
```

### 5. **Enhanced Error Handling**
**Why:** Better visibility into failures, prevent silent errors.

**What improved:**
- All critical scripts have proper error checking
- Python validation with structured output
- Clear error messages in job summaries
- Non-critical steps use `continue-on-error`

## üìä Monitoring & Alerts

### GitHub Actions Logs
Access at: `https://github.com/Sevenon7/Tradier_Options/actions`

**What to watch:**
- ‚è∞ Time gate decisions (should match your schedule)
- üì¶ Producer skip messages (indicates existing data)
- ‚úÖ Validation pass/fail status
- üåê Consumer fetch method used (local vs remote)

### Job Summaries
Each workflow run now includes:
- Time gate status with PT time display
- Files generated with sizes
- Validation results
- Final execution status table

### Failure Notifications
The workflow will:
1. Show detailed errors in job summary
2. Mark workflow as failed (red ‚ùå in Actions tab)
3. Send GitHub notification (if you have it enabled)

---

## üîÑ Dependabot Workflow

### Weekly Updates
Every Monday at 9 AM PT, Dependabot will:
1. Check for updated GitHub Actions (new SHAs)
2. Check for Python package updates
3. Create PRs with changelogs
4. Assign to @Sevenon7

### Reviewing PRs
**For GitHub Actions updates:**
```bash
# Check the diff shows only SHA changes
git diff main...dependabot/github-actions/actions-checkout-xxx

# Verify the comment shows version tag
# Should see: "updates `actions/checkout` from 4.1.0 to 4.1.1"

# Merge if tests pass
```

**For Python packages:**
```bash
# Review changelog for breaking changes
# Test locally if major version bump
pip install -r requirements.txt
python leaps_batched_cached.py  # smoke test

# Merge if compatible
```

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "Secret not configured" Error
**Problem:** Workflow fails immediately at validation step.

**Solution:**
1. Go to repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Verify `TRADIER_TOKEN` exists
3. If missing, add it with your Tradier API token

### "SHA verification failed" (Future)
**Problem:** Action SHA doesn't match expected version.

**Solution:**
1. Check if action was updated legitimately
2. Review Dependabot PR or security advisory
3. Update SHA manually if needed

### Time Gate Always Skipping
**Problem:** Workflow runs but always skips execution.

**Solution:**
1. Check current PT time: `TZ=America/Los_Angeles date`
2. Verify cron schedule matches your window
3. Use manual trigger with `skip_time_gate: true` for testing

### Producer Always Skipped
**Problem:** "already=true" every time.

**Solution:**
1. Check if `data/YYYY-MM-DD/` exists and has files
2. Use manual trigger with `force_run: true` to override
3. Verify date resolution logic in time gate

### Consumer Can't Fetch Files
**Problem:** "Failed to fetch data files" error.

**Solution:**
1. Check if `tools/fetch.sh` exists and is executable
2. Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in repo settings
3. Check if producer ran successfully first
4. Try manual run to debug
